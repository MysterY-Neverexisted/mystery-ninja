## Introduction
Hello, I'm MysterY, a guy who does Avee Player since October 2020 and is known for the most accurate Bass Nation template ever reacted.
I'm also known for my Mysterylizer and my sort of "Ray-Trails" which is now a popular thing I guess.
People see me as an Avee expert because I know so much about Avee Player. I mostly use Cubiq's Avee RE Player since OG Avee has less elements.

## This repositories purpose
In this repository I planned to redo my whole website which I have started 2022 but never continued because I was too busy with different things.
I also planned to make a new app called Avee Player Black which will be a mix of After Effects, Vizzy and of course Avee Player.
This app will be on my new website and also should be installable on Phone and PC to allow cross-platforming.
My website should also list a bunch of Avee Player visuals I make and also teach others how to use Avee Player, later Avee Player Black.
